### Insights and Findings
---
- Gender Balance: The dataset contained : 501 males and 471 females, and 43 employess whom refused to disclose their gender and were given a generic name "Prefer Not To Say"

- Salary Insights: Average salary across the company is approximately $73,824.

Highest average salaries are in Business Development ($77,089) and Marketing ($76,775).

Lowest average salaries are in Research and Development ($68,445).

- Performance Ratings: Most common rating is “Average” (45%), Lagos, Abuja, and Kaduna show similar rating distributions, though Abuja has the highest proportion of "Very Good" ratings (11.1%).

- Department Distribution: The most populated departments include Legal, Product Management, and HR.

Less populated: Marketing and Accounting.

### Conclusion
---
The analysis revealed a relatively balanced workforce in terms of gender, with notable variance in salary levels across departments. While most employees are rated “Average,” a significant minority falls into the “Poor” or “Very Poor” categories, suggesting potential performance management opportunities. Departmental and locational trends in performance and compensation can inform future resource allocation.

### Recommendations
---
To tackle gender inequality, Palmoria Group should begin with a gender pay gap audit to identify and address salary disparities. Setting clear KPIs for gender balance in hiring, promotions, and leadership will promote accountability. Bias-free recruitment practices and a strong diversity policy should be enforced across regions.
