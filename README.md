### Conclusion
---
The analysis revealed a relatively balanced workforce in terms of gender, with notable variance in salary levels across departments. While most employees are rated “Average,” a significant minority falls into the “Poor” or “Very Poor” categories, suggesting potential performance management opportunities. Departmental and locational trends in performance and compensation can inform future resource allocation.

### Recommendations
---
To tackle gender inequality, Palmoria Group should begin with a gender pay gap audit to identify and address salary disparities. Setting clear KPIs for gender balance in hiring, promotions, and leadership will promote accountability. Bias-free recruitment practices and a strong diversity policy should be enforced across regions.
